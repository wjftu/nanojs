### Introduction

In today’s digital world, passwords are the first line of defense for protecting personal data, online accounts, and business systems. Weak or predictable passwords are one of the most common causes of security breaches. That’s why generating strong, unique, and hard-to-guess passwords is essential.

A Random Secure Password Generator is a simple yet powerful tool that creates unpredictable passwords with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. In this article, we’ll show you how to build one in JavaScript, how it works under the hood, and how you can use it in your own projects.

Input length of password, click the button, a random password will be generated.


### How it works 

```js 
const charset = ["a","b","A","B","="];
let length = 12;
const array = new Uint32Array(length);
crypto.getRandomValues(array);
const pwd = Array.from(array, num => charset[num % charset.length]).join("");
```

The generator uses a mix of characters:

- Lowercase letters (`a-z`)
- Uppercase letters (`A-Z`)
- Numbers (`0-9`)
- Special symbols (`!@#$%^&*...`)

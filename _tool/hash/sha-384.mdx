### What is SHA-384


**Overview:**  
SHA-384 is a cryptographic hash function in the SHA-2 family, standardized by NIST in 2001. It is essentially SHA-512 with a different initial state and a truncated output of 384 bits, offering strong security with a slightly smaller digest.

**Output Size:**  
- Produces a 384-bit (48-byte) hash.  
- Typically represented as a 96-character hexadecimal string.

**Internal Structure:**  
- Processes data in 1024-bit blocks (like SHA-512).  
- Uses 80 rounds of operations per block.  
- Maintains eight 64-bit words as its internal state.  
- Operations include bitwise logical functions, modular addition, and circular shifts.  
- Built on the Merkle–Damgård construction with SHA-512 internal design.

**Cryptographic Properties:**  
- Deterministic: same input → same output.  
- Strong avalanche effect: small changes in input drastically alter output.  
- One-way function: infeasible to reverse.  
- Collision-resistant: no practical collisions known; more secure against collisions than SHA-256.

**Security:**  
- Provides a higher security margin than SHA-256 due to longer digest and larger internal state.  
- Suitable for high-security applications requiring long digests.

**Performance:**  
- Slightly slower than SHA-256 on 32-bit CPUs but efficient on 64-bit processors.  
- Shares the same structure as SHA-512, making it optimized for platforms supporting 64-bit arithmetic.

**Common Use Cases:**  
- High-security digital signatures.  
- HMAC for secure message authentication in sensitive contexts.  
- TLS/SSL configurations where longer digests are required.  
- Any application requiring stronger collision resistance than SHA-256.

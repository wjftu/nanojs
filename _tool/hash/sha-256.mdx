### What is SHA-256

SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256)

**Overview:**  
SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function and part of the SHA-2 family, published by NIST in 2001. It produces a longer, more secure digest than SHA-1 and is widely used in modern security applications.

**Output Size:**  
- Produces a 256-bit (32-byte) hash.  
- Usually represented as a 64-character hexadecimal string.

**Internal Structure:**  
- Processes data in 512-bit blocks.  
- Uses 64 rounds of operations per block.  
- Maintains eight 32-bit words as its internal state.  
- Operations include bitwise logical functions, modular addition, and circular shifts.  
- Based on the Merkle–Damgård construction like SHA-1, but with enhanced security and complexity.

**Cryptographic Properties:**  
- Deterministic: the same input always produces the same output.  
- Strong avalanche effect: tiny input changes result in drastically different output.  
- One-way: infeasible to reverse the hash to recover the original input.  
- Collision-resistant: no practical collisions are known; designed to withstand attacks up to 2^128 complexity.

**Security:**  
- Considered secure for digital signatures, TLS certificates, file integrity verification, and blockchain applications.  
- Widely used in HMAC constructions for message authentication.

**Performance:**  
- Efficient on both 32-bit and 64-bit processors.  
- Slightly slower than SHA-1 due to longer hash and more rounds, but much stronger security.

**Common Use Cases:**  
- TLS/SSL certificates and HTTPS connections.  
- Cryptocurrencies and blockchain systems (e.g., Bitcoin uses double SHA-256).  
- File integrity checks and digital signatures.  
- HMAC for secure message authentication.

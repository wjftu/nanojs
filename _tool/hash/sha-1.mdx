### What is SHA-1

**SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)**

**Overview:**  
SHA-1 is a cryptographic hash function designed by the NSA and published by NIST in 1995 (FIPS PUB 180-1) as part of the Digital Signature Standard. It was developed as an improvement over SHA-0.

**Output Size:**  
- Produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash.  
- Commonly represented as a 40-character hexadecimal string.

**Internal Structure:**  
- Based on the Merkle–Damgård construction.  
- Processes input in 512-bit blocks.  
- Uses a compression function with 80 rounds of operations.  
- Maintains a 160-bit state divided into 5 words of 32 bits each.  
- Operations include bitwise logical functions, modular addition, and circular shifts.

**Cryptographic Properties:**  
- Deterministic: same input → same output.  
- Avalanche effect: small changes in input drastically change output.  
- One-way: infeasible to reverse hash to recover input.  
- Originally designed to be collision-resistant (~2^80 complexity).

**Security History:**  
- 2005: Theoretical collision attacks discovered.  
- 2017: Practical collision demonstrated by Google and CWI Amsterdam (“SHAttered”).  
- Currently considered broken for collision resistance and unsafe for cryptographic signatures.

**Performance:**  
- Fast on 32-bit and 64-bit CPUs.  
- Historically favored in performance-sensitive applications.  
- Faster than SHA-256 but much weaker in security.

**Legacy Usage:**  
- TLS/SSL certificates (deprecated since 2017).  
- Code signing (Windows Update, Java JARs).  
- Git object hashing (migration to SHA-256 recommended).  
- Checksums for non-security file verification.

**Why Avoid SHA-1 Today:**  
- Collisions are computationally feasible.  
- Not suitable for digital signatures, certificates, or secure integrity checks.  
- Recommended alternatives: SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512.

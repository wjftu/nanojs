import Sum from '@site/src/components/Sum';

<Sum/>

### How to Use the Sum Calculator

Type one number per line in the textbox.

Example 

```
1
3.14
30
```

The calculator will automatically sum all valid numbers.

You'll see the result below:

```
✅ Sum: 34.14
```

If any line contains non-numeric text, you'll see an error like:

```
❌ Line 3 is not a valid number: "abc"
```

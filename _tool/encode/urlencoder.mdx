# Url Encoder

Encode text into URL encoding



import CommonTool from '@site/src/components/CommonTool';



### Url Encoder

<CommonTool
  title="URL Encoder"
  actionLabel="Encode"
  process={(input) => encodeURIComponent(input)}
  placeholder="Enter plain text to convert into URL encoding.."
/>


### How it works 

This tool uses JavaScript functions to safely encode special characters into URL encoding

(e.g., spaces → %20)

```js
const encoded = "plain%20text";
const decoded = encodeURIComponent(text);
console.log(decoded); // "plain text"
```

Input a url encoded text, click the button to encode text to URL encoding text.

Example:

- Plain text : `?q=url+encoder`  
- Encoded: `%3Fq%3Durl%2Bencoder`

### What is Url Encoding 

URL encoding, also known as percent-encoding, is a mechanism for converting characters in a URL into a format that can be safely transmitted over the internet and unambiguously understood by web servers and browsers.

URLs are strictly limited to using the ASCII character set. If a URL contains characters outside this set (like `中文, emojis, etc.`) or characters that have a special meaning in a URL (like `?, &, =, #, /, %`), they must be encoded.

An encoded character is represented by a % sign followed by two hexadecimal digits (e.g., %20 for a space, %C3%BC for ü).

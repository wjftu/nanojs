# RSA Decryptor


RSADecryptor is a lightweight React component that allows you to decrypt messages encrypted with an RSA public key.
It works in the browser using the built-in Web Crypto API and requires the corresponding private key in PEM format.


import RSADecryptor from '@site/src/components/RSADecryptor';





<RSADecryptor />


### How to Use

Obtain your RSA private key in PEM format (must match the public key used for encryption).

Open the RSADecryptor component in your application.

Paste your private key into the first text area.

Paste the encrypted message (Base64 string) into the second text area.

Click Decrypt.

The original message will be displayed in the third text area.

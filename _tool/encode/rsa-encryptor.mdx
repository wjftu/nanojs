# RSA Encryptor


Use RSA public key to encrypt 

RSAEncryptor is a lightweight React component that allows you to encrypt messages using an RSA public key (PEM format).
It uses the browser's built-in Web Crypto API to ensure secure encryption without external libraries.



import RSAEncryptor from '@site/src/components/RSAEncryptor';





<RSAEncryptor />


### How to Use

Obtain a valid RSA public key in PEM format (e.g., from the recipient who owns the private key).

Open the RSAEncryptor component in your app.

Paste the public key in the first text area.

Type the message you want to encrypt in the second text area.

Click Encrypt to generate a Base64-encoded encrypted message.

Send the encrypted message to the owner of the private key for decryption.

### Max Allowed Message Length

- RSA 1024 → ~86 bytes max
- RSA 2048 → ~214 bytes max
- RSA 4096 → ~470 bytes max

# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` represents the price of a stock on the `i`-th day.  

Your goal is to maximize profit by choosing **exactly one day** to buy and **a different later day** to sell the stock.  

Return the *maximum profit* you can achieve from the transaction.  
If no profit is possible, return `0`.

---

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6 - 1 = 5.
Note: You cannot buy on day 2 and sell on day 1 because the selling day must come after the buying day.
```

---

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The price always drops, so no transaction yields a profit.
```

---

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`

---

Instead of checking every possible buy-sell pair, which would be `O(n^2)` , we track two things in one pass:  
1. The lowest price seen so far (`minPrice`)
2. The maximum profit we can make so far (`maxProfit`)

On each day:
- If the current price is lower than `minPrice`, update `minPrice` (this could be a better buy day).
- Otherwise, calculate `price - minPrice` (profit if sold today), 
    and if it's larger than `maxProfit`, update `maxProfit`.


**JavaScript Solution:**

```javascript
var maxProfit = function(prices) {
    let minPrice = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
    let maxProfit = 0;
    
    for (let price of prices) {
        if (price < minPrice) {
            minPrice = price;
        } else if (price - minPrice > maxProfit) {
            maxProfit = price - minPrice;
        }
    }
    
    return maxProfit;
};
```

---

**TypeScript Solution:**

```typescript
function maxProfit(prices: number[]): number {
    let minPrice = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
    let maxProfit = 0;
    
    for (let price of prices) {
        if (price < minPrice) {
            minPrice = price;
        } else if (price - minPrice > maxProfit) {
            maxProfit = price - minPrice;
        }
    }
    
    return maxProfit;
}
```

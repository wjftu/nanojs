# 122 Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`-th day.

On each day, you may choose to buy and/or sell the stock. You can hold at most one share at a time.
However, you can buy it again after selling it.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve.

---

**Example 1:**
```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: 
Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 3.
Total profit = 4 + 3 = 7.
```

---

**Example 2:**
```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation:
Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 4.
```

---

**Example 3:**
```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: No transaction is done.
```

---

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`

---

### Solution 

Key Idea

The problem allows **multiple transactions**, but you can only hold one share at a time.
The best way to maximize profit is to **sum up every positive price difference** between consecutive days.

If prices go up from one day to the next, we simulate buying yesterday and selling today to capture the gain.

Step-by-Step Example

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
```

Day 1 to Day 2: price drop, do nothing.  
Day 2 to Day 3: +4 profit (buy at 1, sell at 5)  
Day 3 to Day 4: price drop, do nothing.  
Day 4 to Day 5: +3 profit (buy at 3, sell at 6)  
Day 5 to Day 6: price drop, do nothing.  

Total profit = 4 + 3 = 7.

Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:** O(n)   
Single pass through the price list.

**Space Complexity:** O(1)   
Only one variable to store profit.


**JavaScript Solution:**
```javascript
var maxProfit = function(prices) {
    let profit = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
        if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
            profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
        }
    }
    return profit;
};
```

---

**TypeScript Solution:**
```typescript
function maxProfit(prices: number[]): number {
    let profit = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
        if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
            profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
        }
    }
    return profit;
}
```

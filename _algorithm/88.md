# LeetCode 88 Merge Sorted Array

**Description**

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in **non-decreasing order**, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

Merge `nums2` into `nums1` as one sorted array **in-place**.

The final sorted array should also be sorted in **non-decreasing order**.

> Note: `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

Example 1

```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.
```

Example 2

```
Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
```

Example 3

```
Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is just a placeholder.
```

Constraints

- `nums1.length == m + n`
- `nums2.length == n`
- `0 <= m, n <= 200`
- `1 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 10⁹`
- `nums1` and `nums2` are sorted in non-decreasing order

- Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in **O(m + n)** time?

Solution

Merge from the end to avoid overwriting elements in nums1


```js
var merge = function (nums1, m, nums2, n) {
  let idx1 = m - 1
  let idx2 = n - 1
  let idx = m + n - 1
  while (idx1 >= 0 && idx2 >= 0) {
    if (nums1[idx1] > nums2[idx2]) {
      nums1[idx--] = nums1[idx1--]
    } else {
      nums1[idx--] = nums2[idx2--]
    }
  }
  while (idx2 >= 0) {
    nums1[idx--] = nums2[idx2--]
  }
};
```

Time Complexity: O(m + n)  

Space Complexity: O(1)

# 274 H-Index

Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their `i`-th paper, compute the researcher's **h-index**.

The h-index is defined as: A scientist has index `h` if `h` of their `n` papers have at least `h` citations each, and the other `n âˆ’ h` papers have no more than `h` citations each.

Example 1:

```
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: The researcher has 5 papers in total.
3 of them have at least 3 citations each and the remaining 2 have no more than 3 citations each.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: citations = [1,3,1]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == citations.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5000`
- `0 <= citations[i] <= 1000`

**Approach (Sorting / Greedy)**

1. Sort `citations`.
2. Iterate through the sorted array from large to small number. For each paper at index `i`, check if citation is large or equal to count.


Time Complexity: O(n log n)  
Space Complexity: O(1) if in-place sorting.

Solution:

**Javascript Solution**

```js
var hIndex = function(citations) {
    citations.sort((a, b) => b - a)
    let h = 0
    for(let i = 0; i < citations.length; i++) {
        if(citations[i] >= i + 1) {
            h = i + 1
        } else {
            break
        }
    }
    return h
};
```

**TypeScript Solution**

```ts
function hIndex(citations: number[]): number {
    citations.sort((a, b) => b - a)
    let h = 0
    for(let i = 0; i < citations.length; i++) {
        if(citations[i] >= i + 1) {
            h = i + 1
        } else {
            break
        }
    }
    return h
};
```
